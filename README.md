# mtcs-client-server
A multi threaded chat server and client

I created this program as an assignment, however I added the GUI for the client chat in order to make it look better. This
program took me about a week to complete so there might be some bugs, but it definately runs.
In order to run these programs just compile and run the chat server using: 
### javac ChatServer.java 

then run it using:
### java ChatServer

Same thing goes for the client chat
compile:
### javac ClientChat.java

run:
### java ClientChat
